1) Do you have any changes to you paper prototype?
	There should be a directions button that will open up your default mapping 
	application to take you to the selected location.

	The filters is the slide out should be labeled more clearly.

	Add more ways to close the sidebar
		Swipe
		Tap on map
		Press back button (currently the only option)

	Removing heat map from design.

	Remove time filter because time is dependent on another filter (Distance).

	Add search bar on map (Maybe just leave this to google maps)
	We could make it so you could share a location from your mapping service to ours
	and we would use that data to populate our map.

2) Status update of the final project
	Front end is app is moving along as expected.

	Backend work is very behind. Need Firebase database to store location ratings
	per demographic.

3) What difficulties do you have?
	Getting the Google maps view to display properly inside our app.
